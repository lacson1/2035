I've created a test admin account for you:

### Login Credentials:
- **Email**: `admin@test.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Role**: Admin (first user automatically becomes admin)

## 🚀 How to Login

1. **Open your frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (or your Vercel URL)
2. **Enter credentials**:
   - Email: `admin@test.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. **Click "Login"**

## 📝 Create Your Own Account

You can also create a new account:

1. **Go to login page**
2. **Click "Don't have an account? Sign up"**
3. **Fill in your details**
4. **First user becomes admin automatically**

## 🔄 Reset Password (if needed)

If you need to reset the admin password:

```bash
cd backend
node reset-admin-password.js
```

This will reset the admin password to `password123`.
